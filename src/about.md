## About

I'm a self-taught software developer with interests in literature, photography and music.
This place is where I write stuff I think is worth sharing with the web.

I create [tools](http://github.com/subiabre) to help me better understand or navigate the world and sometimes I also like to write about why and how I created them, i.e rant about how they were particularly special to implement and rambling about how they were particularly important to be built. Other times I just let go of some personal thoughts, also mostly software related.

This site is built using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for the functionality and [terminal.css](https://terminalcss.xyz) for the looks. Peek the code at [github](https://github.com/subiabre/xyz).
