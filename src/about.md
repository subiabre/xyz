## About

I'm a self-taught software developer with interests in literature, [photography](http://instagram.com/facu.jpg) and [music](http://last.fm/user/f7701).

I create [tools](http://github.com/subiabre) to help me better understand or navigate the world and sometimes I also like to write about _why_ and _how_ I created them.

Other times I just let go of some personal thoughts, also mostly software related.
