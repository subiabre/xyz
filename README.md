# xyz

This repository holds the code for the site at [subiabre.xyz](https://subiabre.xyz) which is my sort of blog. It was first hosted at [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) which is why it still carries on some legacy related to glitch.com but now it lives at its own Amazon S3 space and I'm working on revamping it up a little to be more personal.
